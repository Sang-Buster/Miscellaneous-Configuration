1. Go to your RStudio installation path, find the folder named `themes` , folder path may differ between operating systems. (I.e., in Windows, the default path may be located at `C:\Program Files\RStudio\resources\themes`, where other `.rstheme` files are also located in there.)

2. Download the `One-Dark.rstheme` or `Nord.rstheme` above, move the `.rstheme` file into `themes` folder.

3. Apply the theme by going into RStudio IDE, in the menu bar, find `Tools > Global Options > Appearance > Editor theme:`, select the theme you want, and click `Apply` to enjoy! :)
